/*
-- Node
Nodes are the objects that comprise a Scene.
Each node may have one or more children, and a transform (position, rotation, and scale) that applies to all of its
descendants. A node may also reference (or "instantiate") other resources at its location, including Mesh, Camera,
Light, and Skin properties. A node cannot be part of more than one Scene.
*/

/*
-- Mesh
Meshes define reusable geometry (triangles, lines, or points) and are instantiated by Nodes.

Each draw call required to render a mesh is represented as a Primitive. Meshes typically have only a single Primitive,
but may have more for various reasons. A mesh manages only a list of primitives â€” materials, morph targets, and other
properties are managed on a per- primitive basis.
*/

/*
-- Primitive
Meshes typically have only a single Primitive, although various cases may require more. Each primitive may be assigned
vertex attributes, morph target attributes, and a material. Any of these properties should be reused among multiple primitives
where feasible.
